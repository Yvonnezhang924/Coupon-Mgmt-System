# Coupon-Mgmt-System

# Function Intro
This project is a **Coupon Distribution Platform** designed for both consumers and merchants. Customers can easily manage their coupons, while merchants can distribute them directly through the platform.

To handle high traffic during limited amount of coupon releases, we use **Kafka** for real-time processing of large-scale messages. HBase ensures efficient storage and high-performance read/write operations for customer information.

The platform will be tested using Postman for API functionality.
